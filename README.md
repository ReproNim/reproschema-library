# A Library of Reusable Assessments

This repository contains a library of form-based clinical, health, neuropsychological,
and behavioral assessments. These assessments can be used in your own protocols
and we welcome contributions from the community to improve these assessments.

You can read more about the ReproSchema [here](TODO).

## How you can contribute

1. Add new assessments not available in the library.
2. Fix existing assessments, especially adding/updating licensing information
   and references.
3. Add multilingual support to the assessments.

## License
All documentation is licensed CC-BY. 

Each assessment should carry its own license. As we build and clean the library, 
we request that you do your due diligence in vetting the items and in making sure 
you acknowledge the appropriate sources.
