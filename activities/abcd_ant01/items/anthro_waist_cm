Now I'd like you to take your thumbs and find the two pointy bones on the front of your body where a belt might go. Once you find them, trace that bone all the way up to its highest point. (Demonstrate the desired position of the arms. RA can do this to their own body as they're talking, so the participant has more guidance.) 2. Once you find the top part of the bone, keep your fingers there while I place the tape measure across your stomach so it's in line with those points. (RA touches the hip area OVER t-shirt to ensure accuracy of location and places tape measure across stomach in line with participant's fingers.) 3. Please cross your arms, and place your hands on opposite shoulders. Think of giving yourself a hug. I'm now going to reach around you to grab the other end of the tape measure, so that I can get a full measurement of your waist. (Extend the measuring tape around the waist. Take the measurement to the nearest 0.1 cm.)"
